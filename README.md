## ABOUT THE PROJECT:

This week’s homework required us to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that we write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes (this is achieved by media queries).


## SUMMARY:

With a little bit of starter code I dove right in listing my variables that would be used in the my function. After creating the variables, I proceeded to create a series of if/else statements to take in the user responses around the character types they'd like for their password. Once the if/else statements were done, I ran into some trouble showing the user inputs in the final generated password. I struggled with his step until the very end. My password generator appears to display a password at the end of the prompt however the it doesn't take in the user inputs. I will continue to work on this and update this read me. 

Persistence is key.
